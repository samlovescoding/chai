# Chai
A PHP based framework that does things differently that every other framework but similarly to all of them.

## Official Chai Documentation
Chai documentation is hosted at this [website](http://docs.samlovescoding.com/docs/chai/)

## Quick Installation Guide
As Chai does not depend upon any other package, Chai can simply be downloaded as ZIP archive and 
then extracted to your working directory. This repository has the official Chai framework in
master branch.

### Chai is currently under development and will suffer many code-breaking changes as the version is increased.
